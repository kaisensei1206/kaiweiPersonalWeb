            Growing up in Vietnam, I strongly believe that computers have had
            a profound impact on modern human history. Computers make life
            easier for human beings in various ways.

            Academically, I have excelled in Logic Thinking and done well in
            Mathematics and Programming skills. I am fulfilling and satisfied
            after solving a question. I enjoy the process of looking for
            programming problem. 
            I know that I should devote 
            myself wholeheartedly to learning various programming technologies 
            and frameworks to get into the world of tech. 
            Therefore, I have made a special effort to enhance my proficiency 
            in programming skills.

            Academically, I have excelled in logical thinking and programming skills.
            I find great fulfillment in problem-solving, whether it’s executing a programming 
            solution perfectly or tackling a challenging question.in my third year, I began 
            exploring backend technologies like Node.js and databases, which sparked a growing 
            interest. Since then, I have dedicated myself to strengthening my backend development 
            skills, motivated by the potential impact they can have in both the tech industry and society.

            To grow further, I am eager to become involved in community work.
            I participated in flag selling every year when I stayed in Vietnam. 
            Also, I have worked as a volunteer many time  in Taiwan.
            I have developed a sense of empathy. I strongly believe that I
            have to learn to put ourselves into others’ shoes and learn to
            make contributions to our society.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe that I can showcase my talent to stand in technology and
              would be mutually beneficial and the society.
